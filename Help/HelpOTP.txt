How to verify your identity by using a One Time Pin

Description of OTP: Unlike your usual OTP where you should just retype the message that has been sent to your phone; this One Time Pin will use a generated phrase that you should decode/decipher. You will turn the phrase into a number.

Purpose: The OTP verifies your identity

The computer will generate a Phrase. This Phrase will only consist of capital letters and will have a length of 6 characters. You should decode the phrase and turn it into a number by looking the keypad on the left and use your keyboard to enter the decoded phrase. 

You simply look at the letter/character, find it in the keypad on the screen, and then TYPE the number that corresponds to that character into the edit box. 
The computer will automatically check if your decoded OTP is correct when you have entered 6 characters. If it is, you will be taken to the program designed for your user type, otherwise, you will get a message informing you that it is gone. 

Here's some examples
	Phrase to decode  -  Decoded OTP:
	LBRQIY  -  527749
	XBODWN  -  926396
	RLNWJM  -  756956

NOTE: More than one letter/character is resembled by a number. 
For Example: A, B and C are all resembled by the number 2 (two). All the characters that you should decode are Capital Letters!

If you struggle to decode a Phrase, you can press 'Reset' to generate a new phrase to decode.

If you press the 'Go Back' button, you will be taken back so that you can reselect an option to verify yourself.
