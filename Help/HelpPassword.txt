To make sure your password isn't easy to crack, we use a strength metering system.
Your password cannot contain a space, and it cannot be longer than 29 characters.

How the strength is determined:
High Strength passwords need to have the following:
	- 2 or more lower case letters
	- 2 or more higher case letters
	- 2 or more numbers
	- 3 or more special characters
	- Length of 11 or more characters
	
Medium Strength Passwords need to have the following:
	- 2 or more lower case letters
	- 2 or more higher case letters
	- 1 or more number
	- 1 or more special character
	- Length of 7 or more characters
	
Any other password that isn't Medium or High Strength, is Low strength. If your password is low strength, it will not be valid, and you won't be able to create an account.
